# Example terraform.tfvars file
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your values

# GitHub Configuration
# You can either provide these values or let Terraform get them from gh CLI

# Option 1: Provide GitHub token directly (not recommended for security)
# github_token = "ghp_your_github_token_here"

# Option 2: Provide GitHub owner/username directly  
# github_owner = "your_github_username"

# If you don't provide these values, Terraform will automatically:
# - Get the token from: gh auth token
# - Get the owner from: gh api user
# Make sure you're logged in with: gh auth login

# Repository names (optional, defaults are provided)
# otaku_lt_repo_name = "otaku.lt"
# otaku_lt_sdk_repo_name = "otaku.lt-sdk"
# default_branch = "main"
